# Sentiment analysis - NLTK

**Man**: "Hey baby, I'm tired, is it ok if we just stay home tonight?"

**Woman**: "Sure..."

**Man**: "You are the best"

**Woman**: "I BET IF I WAS MICHELLE YOU WOULD WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME"

Well, that wouldn't happen if you could analyse her message using this sweet sentiment analysis classifier we're about to build.

Just kidding, it would still happen, but it's good fun, promise!

This uses NLTK to train Naive Bayes classifier using NLTK's movie review database to analyse sentiment.
